# Simple configuration files management

This repository is inspired by other "dotfiles" repos, particularly [this one by @kalkayan](https://github.com/kalkayan/dotfiles).  It does _not_ contain any top-level non-hidden files like README.md or LICENSE to ensure that it can be cloned as a bare repo in your home directory to track all your desired config, without cluttering your home directory with extraneous files.

## Start using these dotfiles

Start by forking this repository and removing any code you don't want or neeed. This repo contains _my_ configuration files, and you are welcome to use it as a starting point, but you are likely to prefer something else.

Note that you can conveniently use GitHub's web editor, accessed via the `.` (dot/period) key, to edit the repo on the web before you make a local clone.  Alternatively, first make a local clone in a throw-away location, do your preferred cleanup there, and then proceed with the next section where you'll make a bare repo clone for actual usage.

### Clone your fork as a `bare` repository

The main advantage of this setup, and the reason this repository doesn't have _any_ non-dot files, is that you can directly clone its contents into your `$HOME` directory and have your dotfiles version-controlled without further configuration. For that to work, you need to do something sligthly unusual: to clone the repo as a _bare_ repo and set your working directory to be `$HOME`:

```bash
# after forking replace the <username> with your github handle
git clone --bare https://github.com/<username>/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles
````

Bare repositories do not have a working tree in their normal directory, instead they only contain the raw data, and we'll be using as our working tree `$HOME` itself. For this to work, whenever operating on this repo, your `git` call must _always_ include these two flags:

- `--work-tree` - this can be your home directory, i.e., `$HOME` or `~`)
- `--git-dir` - where the repository is cloned - `$HOME/.dotfiles` 

For convenience, we will alias this in our `.bashrc`  file as:

```bash
alias dotfiles='git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME'
```

and from now on, instead of typing `git` you will type `dotfiles` to operate on this special repo.

> :warning: The command `dotfiles status` will show all the untracked files, which in your home directory is likely a lot. To disable this behavior, use:
>
> ```bash 
> # remove untracked files and directories from git status listings
> dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no 
> ```

### Once cloned, check out the main branch into `$HOME`

You can now checkout the main branch into `$HOME`, to get the working copy of your files 

```bash
git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME checkout main
```

## Benefits of this setup

1. Easy setup on new machines of all your default configuration preferences.

1. Use all git commands (via the `dotfiles` alias) like `status`, `log`, `diff`, etc., to track the status of your config files.

1. Use git features like branches to maintain specific sets of configuration that you may want to use in certain machines or scenarios, easily switching between them.  You can basically use named branches as system profiles that are readily available and centrally managed.
